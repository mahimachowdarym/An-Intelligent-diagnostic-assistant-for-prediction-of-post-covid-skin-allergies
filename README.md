__Decision Trees__:

Decision Trees demonstrated moderate performance with an accuracy of 40%.
While Decision Trees offer interpretability, they may suffer from overfitting and lack robustness compared to other models.

__Logistic Regression__:

Logistic Regression achieved a slightly higher accuracy of 42%.
Logistic Regression provides a probabilistic framework for classification but may struggle with non-linear relationships in the data.

__Support Vector Machines (SVM)__:

SVM exhibited a classification accuracy of 34%, which was lower compared to other models.
SVM's strength lies in its ability to handle high-dimensional data and find optimal hyperplanes but may require careful parameter tuning.

__K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)__:

KNN yielded an accuracy of 35%, similar to SVM.
KNN's simplicity and non-parametric nature make it easy to implement but may suffer from the curse of dimensionality and computational inefficiency.

__Ensemble Methods__:

Ensemble methods, including Gradient Boosting, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, XGBoost, and Stochastic Gradient Boosting, outperformed individual classifiers.
Gradient Boosting achieved the highest accuracy of 47%, followed closely by XGBoost.
Ensemble methods leverage the diversity of base models to improve classification accuracy and robustness.

In summary, while individual classifiers such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN demonstrated modest performance, ensemble methods emerged as the most effective approach for diagnosing post-COVID-19 skin allergies. Ensemble techniques, particularly Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, achieved higher accuracies and demonstrated robustness in classification tasks. These results highlight the importance of leveraging ensemble methods to improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability in clinical settings. Further research and optimization of these models are warranted to enhance their performance and applicability in real-world scenarios.
