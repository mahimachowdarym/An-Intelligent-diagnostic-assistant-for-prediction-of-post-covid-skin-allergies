Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Skin allergies, especially in individuals recovering from COVID-19, have become increasingly prevalent. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to assist in the rapid diagnosis and classification of skin allergies post-COVID-19.

Scope and Objectives <a name="scope-and-objectives"></a>
The scope of this project includes collecting and preprocessing image data of skin rashes, extracting relevant features, and applying various machine learning classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K Nearest Neighbor, and ensemble methods. The primary objectives are to achieve early diagnosis, ease analysis, and provide cost-effective solutions for dermatological issues post-COVID-19.

Background <a name="background"></a>
The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to various skin-related complications, including allergies. This section provides context on the prevalence of skin issues among COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers, highlighting the need for effective diagnostic solutions.
